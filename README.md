### Project Description:

#### To-Do List:
- [X] Initialize the project workspace (completed by @calderslom)
- [X] Implement Dijkstra’s APSP algorithm
- [X] Implement Floyd’s APSP
- [X] Part 1: Implement both algorithms using an adjacency matrix representation of graphs in Java. Generate random graphs of size between |V| = 500 to 1000 with density 5 (medium). Compare the two algorithms by plotting the time needed (y-axis) to compute the APSP for each of these graph sizes (graph size is plotted on the x-axis).
- [X] Part 2: Generate graphs of the same size (|V| = 5000) with varying density values between 1 and 9. Plot the running time of both methods from Part I, with the running time on the y-axis and the density of the graph on the x-axis.
- [X] Create graphs for part 1
- [X] Create graphs for part 2
- [X] Write up report commenting on the graphs
